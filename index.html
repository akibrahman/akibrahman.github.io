				<p Class="Background">Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below for those interested. Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" by Cicero are also reproduced in their exact original form, accompanied by English versions from the 1914 translation by H. Rackham.</p>

				<p Class="Heading">Patriotism</p>
				<p>Patriotism is the love and respect for one’s country. It is not about blindly following the beliefs and cultural values of the country. It is to take pride in one’s origin and work for the prosperity of the country. Patriotism is very important. The feeling must especially be born in the youth of the country so they act as responsible citizens. Youth is the future of the nation and for the bright future of the country it is important for them to protect and preserve the nation and act in its best interest to make it outshine.We should stop complaining about the flaws of our government and instead work for the growth and development of the country. It is better to be the change first to bring the change. It is important to love the nation we live in and focus more on what it has given to us and what we can give back to it. We need to be united and stand together for the progress of the country for its improvement.It is important to show patriotism in our actions and be proud of the country we live in. We all need to always stay united and devoted for the betterment of our nation.Patriotism is the feeling of love and devotion for one’s country and a sense of alliance and brotherhood with its citizens. It is to unconditionally support and respect the nation. Patriotism develops naturally and is important for the protection of a country’s culture and historical heritage. It is to take pride in representing one’s nation.An excess of patriotism in the defense of a nation is called chauvinism; another related term is jingoism.The concept of Patriotism in American differs radically from the original European meaning. The English word 'Patriot' derived from "Compatriot," in the 1590s, from Middle French "Patriote" in the 15th Century. The French word's <Span>"Compatriote" and "Patriote" originated directly from Late Latin Patriota "fellow-countryman" in the 6th Century. From Greek Patriotes "fellow countryman," from Patrios "of one's fathers," Patris "fatherland." The term Patriot was "applied to barbarians who were perceived to be either uncivilized or primitive who had only a common Patris or fatherland." The original European meaning of Patriots applied to anyone who was a fellow countryman originated from that country regardless of the social-economic status.The general notion of civic virtue and group dedication has been attested in culture globally throughout the historical period.[citation needed] For the Enlightenment</Span> thinkers of 18th-century Europe, loyalty to the state was chiefly considered in contrast to loyalty to the Church. It was argued that clerics should not be allowed to teach in public schools since their patrie was heaven, so that they could not inspire love of the homeland in their students. One of the most influential proponents of this classical notion of patriotism was Jean-Jacques Rousseau.Enlightenment thinkers also criticized what they saw as the excess of patriotism. In 1774, Samuel Johnson published The Patriot, a critique of what he viewed as false patriotism. On the evening of 7 April 1775, he made the famous statement, "Patriotism is the last refuge of the scoundrel."[6] James Boswell, who reported this comment in his Life of Johnson, does not provide context for the quote, and it has therefore been argued that Johnson was in fact attacking the false use of the term "patriotism" by contemporaries such as John Stuart, 3rd Earl of Bute (the patriot-minister) and his supporters; Johnson spoke elsewhere in favor of what he considered "true" patriotism.[7] However, there is no direct evidence to contradict the widely held belief that Johnson's famous remark was a criticism of patriotism itself.</p>
